  - EBYTE E28-2G4M27S (http://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.aspx?id=537)

The antenna used for the E78 is designed by F. Ferrero (https://github.com/FabienFerrero/) and the board is inspired by this board: https://github.com/FabienFerrero/UCA_Education_Board

## Design files
The gerbers can be found in /ressources/gerbers. There is a panel version with 2 boards on a 100x100 mm PCB.

The schematic and the BOM (from LCSC, parts might not be available) are in the /ressources folder.
